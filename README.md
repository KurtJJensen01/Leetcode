# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode** repository! 🎯

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each solution reflects my approach and thought process while solving these challenges, showcasing different algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem is stored in a directory named after the problem title or number.
- Each directory contains:
  - **Solution Code**: The implementation of the solution in the respective language.
  - **README.md** (optional): A description of the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.

## Languages Used
Most of my solutions are written in:
- C++
- Python
- Java

Other languages may appear depending on the problem and experimentation.

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal tracker for my coding progress.
- A reference for revisiting solutions and optimizing them.
- A way to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and proficiency in algorithms and data structures to prospective employers.
- A resource for others to learn or gain insights into solving problems.

## Contributions
If you find any issue with the solutions or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to:
- Open an issue.
- Submit a pull request with a better solution or additional commentary.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are my personal implementations and are meant for learning purposes. Please do not copy-paste them directly if you're solving LeetCode problems, as it defeats the purpose of learning and improving your coding skills.
